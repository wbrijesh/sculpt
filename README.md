# Sculpt
Inspired by tools like Hasura, AWS's Amplify that generate api from schema, I am building my own.

**NOTE:** The generated code works only the the example struct used in `main.go`, Sculpt will be ready for actual use with release of `v1.0.0` 

## Installation

```
$ go get github.com/wbrijesh/sculpt
```
